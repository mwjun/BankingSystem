1. Initialization and Setup

When you run the program, the following sequence of events occurs:

 • main.cpp is the entry point of the program. It starts by creating an instance of the CBST class, which is a Binary Search Tree (BST) specifically designed to store CPersonInfo objects.

CBST<CPersonInfo> personTree;

 • The program then opens the file PersonBankInfo.txt and reads the data line by line.

std::ifstream inputFile("PersonBankInfo.txt");
if (!inputFile) {
    std::cerr << "Unable to open file PersonBankInfo.txt";
    return 1;
}

2. Reading Data and Inserting into the Tree

 • For each line in the file, the program reads the first name, last name, age, checking account balance, and savings account balance. These values are used to create a CPersonInfo object.

std::string firstName, lastName;
int age;
double checking, savings;

while (inputFile >> firstName >> lastName >> age >> checking >> savings) {
    CPersonInfo person(firstName, lastName, age, checking, savings);
    personTree.add(person);
}

 • The newly created CPersonInfo object is then inserted into the binary search tree (personTree). The tree is ordered by the age of each person because the CBST class uses the < operator defined in CPersonInfo for comparisons.

3. Binary Search Tree (BST) Insertion

 • When the add method is called on personTree, it inserts the CPersonInfo object into the correct position in the tree according to the person’s age. The insertion is done recursively in the placeNode function, ensuring that the tree maintains its binary search property.

4. Tree Structure and Operations

 • Tree Structure:
 • The tree is structured such that for any given node, the left child node contains a person younger than the person in the current node, and the right child node contains a person older than the person in the current node.
 • Tree Operations:
 • The BST allows for various operations, such as adding new people, searching for people by age, and removing people from the tree. The program currently focuses on adding and potentially displaying the data in the tree.

5. Balancing the Tree (Optional for AVL Trees)

 • If you were to implement an AVL tree (which is a self-balancing binary search tree), the program would automatically balance itself after every insertion. This involves performing rotations (left or right) to ensure that the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is no more than one.

6. Program Output and Usage

 • As written, the program reads the data and populates the tree. You could extend it to perform additional operations, such as searching for a specific person, displaying the tree in-order (which would list people by age), or deleting entries.

7. Running the Program

To run this program:

1. Compile all the .cpp and .h files using a C++ compiler, such as g++.
Example command:

g++ main.cpp CPersonInfo.cpp CBST.cpp CBinaryNodeTree.cpp -o person_tree

2. Run the compiled program:

./person_tree

3. Observe the output:

 • If you extend the main.cpp with additional print statements or functionality, you could see the tree structure, search for a person by age, etc.

Conclusion:

 • The program reads data from a file, stores it in a structured format (binary search tree), and provides a foundation for further operations like searching, modifying, and balancing the tree.
 • You could extend the program to implement an AVL tree by adding rotation logic, enabling the tree to balance itself after each insertion or deletion.
